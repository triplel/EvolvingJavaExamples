EvolvingJavaExamples
====================

examples from Brian Goetz's talk on Java 8

The purporse of this project is to demonstrate some of the new features introduced into Java 8, including:
- Lambda Expressions / Closures
- Interface Evolutions
- Bulk Data Operations On Collections
- More Library Support On Parallelism

Most of the source code I wrote here drove from Brian Goetz's talk "Evolving Java".

To run the code, you should install the JDK 1.8 (public review edition as of Dec 2013), here is the link to download the jdk https://jdk8.java.net/download.html
